*Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course.*

AP Computer Science Principles is a course taught at Golden Valley High School. It provides an overview of computer science. The course's Conceptual Framework divides the curriculum into five big ideas. Additionally, the framework includes six Computational Thinking Practices that are the assessed on tasks on the AP Exam. Each learning objective in the course is aligned to the skills in the practices.

**Big Ideas:**
1. Creative Development
2. Data
3. Algorithms and Programming
4. Computer Systems and Networks
5. Impact of Computing

**Computational Thinking Practices:**
1. Computational Solution Design
2. Algorithms and Program Development
3. Abstraction in Program Development
4. Code Analysis

6. Responsible Computing

This plan will expand on the essential understandings and skills students should develop through the course, focusing on the impacts of computing on society. Additionally, this plan will outline how students in the course can help build a computing culture that is safe and welcoming for all students, even those who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives and Skills

*Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/*

The impacts of computers and programs can be wide-ranging, with both intentional and unintentional effects on communities and economies at large. Students need to investigate different computing innovations while also coming to understand how to contribute to a computing culture that is inclusive, collaborative, safe, and ethical. This big idea does not stand alone and should be integrated throughout the course as it dovetails nicely with the other big ideas of the course (CollegeBoard, 2020).

### Learning Activities

*Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?*

All learning activities for the year should be designed using the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to ensure an equitable learning experience for all students. The learning experiences need to be student-centered, relevant to the students' lives, offerring authentic choice and ways to incorporate the students' own backgrounds and interests. The activities should afford students opportunities to express their own creativity and to create solutions that solve personally relevant problems. 

Communication is vital to establishing a computing culture in the classroom. Students will help each other progress through the concepts by actively participating in discussions, giving peer feedback to each other, and sharing their personal reflections. The goal is to build the students' capacity to observe the world around them, create their own questions about the problems they see, develop their own solutions to said questions and problems, and analyze their own work for possible issues and/or improvements. 

**CS Heroes Warm-Ups**
1. *Select one CSTA CS Hero*
  * Choose one hero to highlight; the heroes can be found at the bottom of the [CSEDWeek website](https://www.csedweek.org/teach).
2. *Video (or Poster or Article)*
  * Show the video to the students.
3. *CS Journal*
  * Have students answer prompts about the hero, which can include:
    * What problem is [the hero's name] solving?
    * How was computer science used in the solution?
    * What possible issues might this [solution/application/computing] create?
    * Are there other ways we could use this [solution/application/computing] to solve problems in the world?
4. *Pair-Share*
  * Have students share their responses with their partner.
5. *Class Discussion*
  * Discuss the students' answers to the prompts.

There are enough CS heroes identified by CSTA that this warm-up can be used every two weeks or so, allowing students to have exposure to a variety of computing innovations and real-world solutions.


**Position Statement Activity**
1. *Individual Read:*
  * Students read an article or reading passage, marking any information they want to learn more about. At the end, they write a 10 word summary of the article.
2. *Group (or Class) Discussion:*
  * As a group (or whole class), students should share their summaries and discuss the main content of the article. Unfamiliar words or concepts should be looked up. The goal of the discussion is to have each student be comfortable with the content of the article.
3. *Individual Re-Read:*
  * Students re-read the article, looking specifically for the benefits, harms, and impacts involved with the computing innovation being discussed. They should annotate the article with symbols to show the sentences that discuss the benefits (+), harms (-) or impacts (*).   
4. *Group (or Class) Discussion:*
  * Students should check back in with their groups (or the class) to share some of the sentences that they annotated. Did everyone identify the same areas?
5. *Position Statement:*
  * Students should answer an essential question that pertains to the computing innovation in the article. For example, "Is our world better or worse because of digital representation?" or "Are our current copyright policies helping society or hurting society?" are questions that might be posed when discussing digital information or copyright/creative commons. Their claims need to be supported by at least one quotation from the article.
  * Students should also outline the benefits and harms of the computing innovation. 

This activity should be revisited often throughout the course, as it prepares the students for the reading passage on computing innovations that is on the AP Exam in May. Students should investigate a range of topics using this format, including but not limited to:
* Intellectual Property and Copyright Issues of Digitizing Information
  * *[Fortnite Stealing Dance Moves](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zs-d_4L53qgPCtdg1e9Gw00QMx8NQpt0/view)*

**Policy Proposal Activity**




Students should investigate computing innovations a minimum of three times prior to the AP Exam in May. When presented with a computing innovation, students should analyze a number of aspects of that innovation:
* What data is used to complete the task involved
* How that data is secured, stored, accessed, and kept private as appropriate
* How society, the economy, or culture is affected, whether good or ill




### Assessment

*Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.*

Topics in the big idea *Impact of Computing* account for 21-26% of the AP Exam score. On the end-of-course exam, students will receive one reading passage about a computing innovation. Students then need to answer five questions about data and the effects of the computing innovation. To this end, it is beneficial to the students to investigate a range of computing innovations throughout the course. Additionally, 

### Outcomes

*Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broaden participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.*

AP Computer Science Principles focuses on "creative problem solving and real-world applications to better prepare [students] for college and career" (CollegeBoard, 2022). With a continual focus on computer science in the real world and the impact of computing innovations, students should be well able to articulate computing's impact on society, the economy, and culture. In turn, students can begin to view the world around them critically, brainstorming and planning solutions to the problems they see in their own lives and community, ever mindful of the need to be inclusive and unbiased. 

In an effort to inspire more students to enroll in the course (and other computer science courses) at GVHS, a number of tasks can be done throughout the year:
1. Hold *Hour of Code* sessions during after-school ASSETS and Saturday Academies (one session per month).
  * Have each session focus on a different activity. Use [Code.org's curated options](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn), [CodeHS.com's offerings](https://codehs.com/course/catalog?ref=23&ms=false&hs=false&tab=hoc&state=catalog-all) or develop new activities.
  * Promote the sessions on social media; coordinate with leadership to post to the school's accounts. Use the images on [Code.org's resources page](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources).
  * Promote the sessions by hanging posters around school. A variety of posters are available on [Code.org's resources page](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources).
2. Hold a *Family Code Night* event (in the first semester) as a family/community outreach.
  * Coordinate with administration as to facilities usage and what night works best for the event and with the teacher-librarian to announce the event on the school website.
  * Code.org offers a free [event kit](http://www.familycodenight.org/get-started.html). The kit includes all materials needed to organize, promote, and hold the event.
3. Work with leadership and the activities director to adopt CSEdWeek (first week in December). 
  * Highlight a different Computer Science Hero each day on the GVTV bulletin.
  * Develop daily lunch activities that leadership students can help run. These may include short "unplugged" coding tasks, games, or simiilar. 
4. Promote computer science at the annual Course Fair (late January).
  * Have inspirational computer science videos playing on a loop.
  * Have different examples of student projects available for students and parents to see.
