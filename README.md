# Impacts on Society

AP Computer Science Principles is a course taught at Golden Valley High School. It provides an overview of computer science. The course's Conceptual Framework divides the curriculum into five big ideas. Additionally, the framework includes six Computational Thinking Practices that are the assessed on tasks on the AP Exam. Each learning objective in the course is aligned to the skills in the practices.

**Big Ideas:**
1. Creative Development
2. Data
3. Algorithms and Programming
4. Computer Systems and Networks
5. Impact of Computing

**Computational Thinking Practices:**
1. Computational Solution Design
2. Algorithms and Program Development
3. Abstraction in Program Development
4. Code Analysis
5. Computing Innovations
6. Responsible Computing

This plan will expand on the essential understandings and skills students should develop through the course, focusing on the impacts of computing on society. Additionally, this plan will outline how students in the course can help build a computing culture that is safe and welcoming for all students, even those who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives and Skills

The impacts of computers and programs can be wide-ranging, with both intentional and unintentional effects on communities and economies at large. Students need to investigate different computing innovations while also coming to understand how to contribute to a computing culture that is inclusive, collaborative, safe, and ethical. This big idea does not stand alone and should be integrated throughout the course as it dovetails nicely with the other big ideas of the course (CollegeBoard, 2020).

**Computational Thinking Practice 1:** Computational Solution Design - Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
* **Skill 1.C:** Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution.

**Computational Thinking Practice 5:** Computing Innovations - Investigate computing innovations
* **Skill 5.C:** Describe the impact of a computing innovation.
* **Skill 5.D:** Describe the impact of gathering data.
* **Skill 5.E:** Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

**Computational Thinking Practice 6:** Responsibly Computing - Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture. *Note: These skills are not assessed on the AP Exam.*
* **Skill 6.A:** Collaborate in the development of solutions.
* **Skill 6.B:** Use safe and secure methods when using computing devices.
* **Skill 6.C:** Acknowledge the intellectual property of others.

**Enduring Understanding CRD-1:** Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing
innovations as they are developed.
* **Topic 1.1:** Collaboration
  * **Learning Objective CRD-1.A:** Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
  * **Learning Objective CRD-1.B:** Explain how computing innovations are developed by groups of people.
  * **Learning Objective CRD-1.C:** Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.â€‚
* **Topic 1.3:** Program Design and Development
  * **Learning Objective CRD-2.H:** Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
* **Topic 5.1:** Beneficial and Harmful Effects
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.A:** Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.B:** Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* **Topic 5.2:** Digital Divide
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.C:** Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide.
* **Topic 5.3:** Computing Bias
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.D:** Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* **Topic 5.4:** Crowdsourcing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.E:** Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.
* **Topic 5.5:** Legal and Ethical Concerns
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.F:** Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-2:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity.
* **Topic 5.6:** Safe Computing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.A:** Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.B:** Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.C:** Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained.

### Learning Activities

*Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?*

**Computing Innovations Activities**
Students should investigate computing innovations a minimum of three times prior to the AP Exam in May. When presented with a computing innovation, students should analyze a number of aspects of that innovation:
* What data is used to complete the task involved
* How that data is secured, stored, accessed, and kept private as appropriate
* How society, the economy, or culture is affected, whether good or ill

### Assessment

*Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.*

Topics in the big idea *Impact of Computing* account for 21-26% of the AP Exam score. On the end-of-course exam, students will receive one reading passage about a computing innovation. Students then need to answer five questions about data and the effects of the computing innovation. To this end, it is beneficial to the students to investigate a range of computing innovations throughout the course. Additionally, 

### Outcomes

*Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broaden participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.*
