# Impacts on Society

*Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course.*

AP Computer Science Principles is a course taught at Golden Valley High School. It provides an overview of computer science. The course's Conceptual Framework divides the curriculum into five big ideas. They are:
* Creative Development
* Data
* Algorithms and Programming
* Computer Systems and Networks
* Impact of Computing

This plan will expand on the big idea of *Impact of Computing* and how it will be incorporated into the course. The plan also includes the ways Golden Valley will seek to build up the computer science enrollment by recruiting students who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

*Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/*

The impacts of computers and programs can be wide-ranging, with both intentional and unintentional effects on communities and economies at large. Students need to investigate different computing innovations while also coming to understand how to contribute to a computing culture that is inclusive, collaborative, safe, and ethical. This big idea does not stand alone and can be integrated throughout the course as it dovetails nicely with the other big ideas of the course (CollegeBoard, 2020).

#### CSP Conceptual Framework

**Enduring Understanding IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
* **Topic 5.1:** Beneficial and Harmful Effects
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.A:** Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.B:** Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* **Topic 5.2:** Digital Divide
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.C:** Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide.
* **Topic 5.3:** Computing Bias
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.D:** Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* **Topic 5.4:** Crowdsourcing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.E:** Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.
* **Topic 5.5:** Legal and Ethical Concerns
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.F:** Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-2:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity.
* **Topic 5.6:** Safe Computing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.A:** Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.B:** Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.C:** Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained.

As students explore the topics of the Impact of Computing, they will develop their skills in the following Computational Thinking Practices:
* **1.C:** Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution.
* **5.C:** Describe the impact of a computing innovation.
* **5.D:** Describe the impact of gathering data.
* **5.E:** Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

* **3B-IC-28:** Debate laws and regulations that impact the development and use of software.

**Networks & the Internet**
* **3B-NI-03:** Describe the issues that impact network functionality (e.g., bandwidth, load, delay, topology).
* **3A-NI-05:** Give examples to illustrate how sensitive data can be affected by malware and other attacks.
* **3A-NI-06:** Recommend security measures to address various scenarios based on factors such as efficiency, feasibility, and ethical impacts.
* **3A-NI-07:** Compare various security measures, considering tradeoffs between the usability and security of a computer system.
* **3B-NI-04:** Compare ways software developers protect devices and information from unauthorized access.

### Learning Activities

*Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?*

**Personal Innovations Activity:** 
*Adapted from the code.org course for Computer Science Principles, [Unit 1, Lesson 1](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2021/lessons/1)*
* *CSP Computational Thinking Practice Skill:* 5.C
* *CSTA Standard:* 3B-IC-27
* *Objectives:* Students will be able to:
 * Communicate with classmates about computing innovations in their lives.
 * Describe positive and negative effects of computing innovations.
* Activity:
 * In groups, students each identify an area of interest. For each area, the group identifies how technology is impacted by or related to those interests. The group then identifies problems or aspects of each interest that technology might help improve or solve. Finally, the group chooses the one idea they feel would be most interesting to their classmates and create a rapid prototype of that idea on a vertical whiteboard, a quick visual representation to convey their chosen idea.
 * Each group will then complete a gallery walk of the other groups' work, adding sticky notes with comments.
 * Finish the activity with a class discussion of what they saw on their gallery walks.
 * Note: Prior to removing sticky notes and erasing the white boards, have each group submit a photograph of their rapid prototypes.

**Intellectual Property Lesson:** 
*Adapted from the code.org course for Computer Science Principles, [Unit 1, Lesson 11](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2021/lessons/11)*
* *CSP Learning Objective:* IOC-1.F
* *CSTA Standard:* 3A-IC-28
* *Objectives:* Students will be able to:
  * Argue if current copyright laws are helping or harming society using evidence from an article.
  * Explain how copyright and Creative Commons Licenses can be applied to digital works of creativity.
* Warm-Up:
  *  Have students answer a prompt about intelletual property: "Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that theyâ€™re selling for $10 each. How would you feel in this situation?"
  *  Discuss student responses, with a goal of showing the complications of the topic. Consider asking students guiding questions similar to:
    * If you are given credit for the drawing on the T-shirt, is it more or less okay?
    * What if this happened 20 years after you posted the image instead of one week? Does that change anything?
    * If the image is converted to a binary number using the pixelation widget, can someone really own a number?
  * Ensure that students understand that materials created on a computer are considered intellectual property, owned by the person who created them. It is plagiarism to use something without the creator's permission, and possibly illegal.
* Activity:
  * Have students read an article, *[Fortnite Stealing Dance Moves](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zs-d_4L53qgPCtdg1e9Gw00QMx8NQpt0/view)*.
  * Students should mark the text with any information they want to know about. Then they should write a 10-word summary of the article.
  * Have a class discussion regarding what questions the students have about copyright, based on the reading and their past experiences.
  * Show three videos about copyright and creative commons:
    * [Copyright Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPNWvU_IphU)
    * [Copyright in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITASCSxnBqw)
    * [Creative Commons Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-m23T7cPM)
  * Have students re-read the article, looking for answers to the following questions:
    * What was digitized?
    * Why was it digitizes?
    * Is someone benefiting from this situation? If so, who?
    * Is someone being harmed in this situation? If so, who?
    * Are these impacts intended or unintended? How do you know?
   * Discuss what the students annotated.
