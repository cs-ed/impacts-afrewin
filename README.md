# Impacts on Society

*Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course.*

AP Computer Science Principles is a course taught at Golden Valley High School. It provides an overview of computer science. The course's Conceptual Framework divides the curriculum into five big ideas. They are:
* Creative Development
* Data
* Algorithms and Programming
* Computer Systems and Networks
* Impact of Computing

This plan will expand on the big idea of *Impact of Computing* and how it will be incorporated into the course. The plan also includes the ways Golden Valley will seek to build up the computer science enrollment by recruiting students who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

*Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/*

The impacts of computers and programs can be wide-ranging, with both intentional and unintentional effects on communities and economies at large. Students need to investigate different computing innovations while also coming to understand how to contribute to a computing culture that is inclusive, collaborative, safe, and ethical. This big idea does not stand alone and can be integrated throughout the course as it dovetails nicely with the other big ideas of the course (CollegeBoard, 2020).

#### CSP Conceptual Framework

As students explore and develop their understanding of the impacts of comuting, they will develop their skills in a variety of Computational Thinking Practices. 

**Computational Thinking Praactice 1:** Computational Solution Design - Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
* **Skill 1.C:** Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution.

**Computational Thinking Practice 5:** Computing Innovations - Investigate computing innovations
* **Skill 5.C:** Describe the impact of a computing innovation.
* **Skill 5.D:** Describe the impact of gathering data.
* **Skill 5.E:** Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

**Computational Thinking Practice 6:** Responsibly Computing - Contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.
* **Skill 6.A:** Collaborate in the development of solutions.
* **Skill 6.B:** Use safe and secure methods when using computing devices.
* **Skill 6.C:** Acknowledge the intellectual property of others.

**Enduring Understanding CRD-1:** Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing
innovations as they are developed.
* **Topic 1.1:** Collaboration
  * **Learning Objective CRD-1.A:** Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.

* **Topic 1.3:** Program Design and Development
  * **Learning Objective CRD-2.H:** Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
* **Topic 5.1:** Beneficial and Harmful Effects
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.A:** Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.B:** Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* **Topic 5.2:** Digital Divide
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.C:** Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide.
* **Topic 5.3:** Computing Bias
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.D:** Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* **Topic 5.4:** Crowdsourcing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.E:** Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.
* **Topic 5.5:** Legal and Ethical Concerns
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.F:** Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-2:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity.
* **Topic 5.6:** Safe Computing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.A:** Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.B:** Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.C:** Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained.

### Learning Activities

*Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?*



**Personal Innovations Activity:**

### Assessment

*Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.*

The Impact of Computing accounts for 21-26% of the AP Exam. On the end-of-course exam, students will receive one reading passage about a computing innovation. Students then need to answer five questions about data and the effects of the computing innovation. To this end, it is beneficial to the students to investigate a range of computing innovations throughout the course. Additionally, 

### Outcomes

*Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broaden participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.*
