# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course.

AP Computer Science Principles is a course taught at Golden Valley High School. It provides an overview of computer science. The course's framework divides the curriculum into five big ideas. They are:
* Creative Development
* Data
* Algorithms and Programming
* Computer Systems and Networks
* Impact of Computing

This plan will expand on the big idea of *Impact of Computing* and how it will be incorporated into the course. The plan also includes the ways Golden Valley will seek to build up the computer science enrollment by recruiting students who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

The impacts of computers and programs can be wide-ranging, with both intentional and unintentional effects on communities and economies at large. Students need to investigate different computing innovations while also coming to understand how to contribute to a computing culture that is inclusive, collaborative, safe, and ethical. This big idea does not stand alone and can be integrated throughout the course as it dovetails nicely with the other big ideas of the course (CollegeBoard, 2020).

**Enduring Understanding IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.
* **Topic 5.1:** Beneficial and Harmful Effects
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.A:** Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.B:** Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
* **Topic 5.2:** Digital Divide
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.C:** Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide.
* **Topic 5.3:** Computing Bias
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.D:** Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
* **Topic 5.4:** Crowdsourcing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.E:** Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.
* **Topic 5.5:** Legal and Ethical Concerns
  * **Learning Objective IOC-1.F:** Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

**Enduring Understanding IOC-2:** The use of computing innovations may involve risks to personal safety and identity.
* **Topic 5.6:** Safe Computing
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.A:** Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.B:** Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused.
  * **Learning Objective IOC-2.C:** Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained.

As students explore the topics of the Impact of Computing, they will develop their skills in the following Computational Thinking Practices:
* **1.C:** Explain how collaboration affects the development of a solution.
* **5.C:** Describe the impact of a computing innovation.
* **5.D:** Describe the impact of gathering data.
* **5.E:** Evaluate the use of computing based on legal and ethical factors.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broaden participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
